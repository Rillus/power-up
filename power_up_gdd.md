## Game Overview

**Title:** Power Up  
**Platform:** Web Browser (HTML5/JavaScript)  
**Genre:** Management/Action hybrid  
**Target Audience:** All ages, museum visitors, casual gamers  
**Core Theme:** Running a computer games exhibition at the Science Museum

### Game Concept
Players take on the role of a volunteer at the Science Museum's "Power Up" exhibition, managing game stations, admitting guests, and maintaining equipment to keep visitors happy and engaged. The game combines real-time action with resource management and progression mechanics.

### Victory/Failure Conditions
- **Primary Goal:** Survive as many days as possible
- **Failure Condition:** Too many guests leave angry (anger threshold: 10 guests per day)

2. **Operating Hours (4-8 minutes)**
   - Admit guests at entrance
   - Monitor console status indicators
   - Rush to repair broken consoles
   - Collect revenue from satisfied guests
   - Manage guest queues and satisfaction

3. **Evening Wrap-up (30 seconds)**
   - Review daily performance
   - Purchase new consoles/upgrades
   - View progression rewards
   - Save progress

### Real-time Mechanics

#### Core Engine Classes
```javascript
/**
 * @class GameEngine - Main engine controller
 * Responsibilities: Game loop, state management, system coordination
 */
class GameEngine {
  constructor(canvas, options = {}) {}
  start() {} // Initialize and start game loop

}

/**
 * @class Entity - Base game object

```

#### System Architecture
```javascript
/**

 */
class InputSystem {
  constructor() {}
  update() {} // Process keyboard/mouse input
  bindKey(key, action) {} // Key binding

```

#### Game Loop with Performance Monitoring
```javascript
class GameLoop {
  constructor(engine, targetFPS = 60) {
    this.engine = engine;
    this.targetFrameTime = 1000 / targetFPS;
    this.lastTime = 0;
    this.accumulator = 0;
    this.frameCount = 0;
    this.fpsCounter = 0;
  }

  /**
   * Main game loop with fixed timestep
   * @param {number} currentTime - Current timestamp
   */
  loop(currentTime) {
    const deltaTime = currentTime - this.lastTime;
    this.lastTime = currentTime;
    this.accumulator += deltaTime;

    // Fixed timestep updates
    while (this.accumulator >= this.targetFrameTime) {
      this.engine.update(this.targetFrameTime);
      this.accumulator -= this.targetFrameTime;
    }

    // Render with interpolation
    const alpha = this.accumulator / this.targetFrameTime;
    this.engine.render(alpha);

    // Performance monitoring
    this.updateFPS(deltaTime);
    
    requestAnimationFrame((time) => this.loop(time));
  }

  updateFPS(deltaTime) {
    this.frameCount++;
    this.fpsCounter += deltaTime;
    
    if (this.fpsCounter >= 1000) {
      console.debug(`FPS: ${this.frameCount}`);
      this.frameCount = 0;
      this.fpsCounter = 0;
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Persistence (Current Session)
**localStorage Structure:**
```json
{
  "characterCustomization": {
    "name": "string",
    "appearance": {...}
  },
  "currentProgress": {
    "day": "number",
    "money": "number",
    "consoles": [...],
    "permanentUpgrades": [...]
  },
  "gameSettings": {
    "audio": {...},
    "controls": {...}
  }
}
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing with Vitest
```javascript
// Example: Console logic testing
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
import { GameConsole } from '../src/entities/GameConsole.js';

describe('GameConsole', () => {
  let console;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    console = new GameConsole(100, 100, 'retro-arcade');
  });

  it('should initialize with correct properties', () => {
    expect(console.type).toBe('retro-arcade');
    expect(console.durability).toBe(20);
    expect(console.isOperational()).toBe(true);
  });

  it('should break down after durability exhausted', () => {
    for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
      console.use();
    }
    expect(console.isOperational()).toBe(false);

  });

  it('should calculate revenue correctly', () => {
    const guest = { type: 'family', satisfaction: 8 };
    const revenue = console.calculateRevenue(guest);
    expect(revenue).toBe(2); // Base revenue for retro-arcade
  });
});

// Example: Guest AI testing
describe('Guest AI', () => {
  it('should choose console based on preferences and queue length', () => {
    const guest = new Guest(0, 0, 'enthusiast');
    const consoles = [
      new GameConsole(100, 100, 'retro-arcade'), // queue: 0
      new GameConsole(200, 100, 'modern-gaming') // queue: 3

   * @param {string} type - Console type ('retro-arcade', 'classic-home', etc.)
   * @param {number} [tier=1] - Upgrade tier (1-3)
   * @throws {Error} When invalid console type provided
   */
  constructor(x, y, type, tier = 1) {
    super(x, y);
    this._validateConsoleType(type);
    // Implementation...
  }

  /**
   * Process guest interaction with console
   * @param {Guest} guest - The guest using the console
   * @returns {number} Revenue generated from interaction
   * @throws {Error} When console is not operational
   */
  use(guest) {
